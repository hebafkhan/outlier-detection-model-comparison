# Outlier Detection and Model Comparison

## Project Overview
This project focuses on comparing different outlier detection models, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised techniques. The models evaluated are:

- **Supervised Models**: Isolation Forest, DBSCAN.
- **Semi-Supervised/Unsupervised Models**: One-Class SVM, Local Outlier Factor.

Evaluation metrics like the F1 Score and Confusion Matrix were used for model comparison, and hyperparameters were tuned to optimize performance.

## Key Features
- Supervised and unsupervised models for anomaly detection.
- Evaluation with F1 score and Confusion Matrix.
- Empirical parameter tuning to improve model performance.
- End-to-end Python implementation.

## Requirements
To run the project, install the necessary Python packages using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
